# ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT ISSUE RESOLUTION

## **ISSUE IDENTIFIED & FIXED** âœ…

### **Problem:**
The deployment was failing because `aiofiles` was missing from `requirements.txt`, even though it was being imported in `app/utils/helpers.py`.

### **Error Message:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiofiles'
```

### **Root Cause:**
The `app/utils/helpers.py` file imports `aiofiles` for PDF processing:
```python
import aiofiles
# ...
async with aiofiles.tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile('wb+', delete=True, suffix='.pdf') as tmp:
```

But `aiofiles` was not listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### **Fix Applied:**
âœ… **Added `aiofiles` to `requirements.txt`**

Updated requirements.txt from:
```
fastapi
uvicorn
motor
pydantic
python-dotenv
pydantic-settings
httpx
PyPDF2>=3.0.0
requests>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
```

To:
```
fastapi
uvicorn
motor
pydantic
python-dotenv
pydantic-settings
httpx
PyPDF2>=3.0.0
requests>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
aiofiles
```
