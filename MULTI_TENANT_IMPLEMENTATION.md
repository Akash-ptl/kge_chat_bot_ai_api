# Multi-Tenant MongoDB Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented multi-tenant MongoDB architecture where each app has its own MongoDB database connection. The main database now only stores app metadata, while all app-specific data (chats, sessions, content, guardrails) is stored in each app's dedicated database.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Model Updates

- **`app/models/app.py`**: Added `mongodbConnectionString` field to `AppModel`
  - This field is now required when creating new apps
  - Stores the MongoDB connection string for each app's dedicated database

### 2. Database Architecture

- **`app/db_manager.py`**: New DatabaseManager class for handling multiple MongoDB connections

  - Manages connection caching and app-specific database access
  - Provides methods to get app collections dynamically
  - Handles connection cleanup and resource management

- **`app/db.py`**: Updated to use the new database manager

  - Maintains backward compatibility for existing code
  - Imports collections from the database manager

- **`app/utils/database.py`**: New utility functions
  - `get_app_and_collections()`: Gets app info and its database collections
  - `get_app_collection_by_name()`: Gets specific collection for an app

### 3. Router Updates

All routers updated to use app-specific databases:

#### Chat Router (`app/routers/chat.py`)

- Updated all functions to use app-specific collections
- `get_session()`, `store_message_and_response()`, `apply_guardrails()`, etc.
- Chat sessions and messages now stored in app's own database

#### Admin Routers

Updated all admin endpoints to use app-specific databases:

- **`app/routers/admin/documents.py`**: Document management with app-specific storage
- **`app/routers/admin/guardrail.py`**: Guardrail management with app-specific storage
- **`app/routers/admin/notes.py`**: Note management with app-specific storage
- **`app/routers/admin/qna.py`**: Q&A management with app-specific storage
- **`app/routers/admin/urls.py`**: URL management with app-specific storage

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

- **`tests/test_multi_tenant.py`**: Comprehensive multi-tenant functionality tests

  - Tests chat isolation between apps
  - Tests content isolation between apps
  - Tests guardrail isolation between apps
  - Creates apps with different MongoDB databases
  - Validates data isolation works correctly

- **`tests/create_valid_app.py`**: Updated to include MongoDB connection string

  - Creates sample app with proper MongoDB configuration
  - Uses separate database for the app

- **`tests/run_tests.py`**: Test runner script
  - Starts API server automatically
  - Runs multi-tenant tests
  - Handles cleanup and process management

## Database Structure

### Main Database (stores app metadata only)

- `apps` collection: App configurations including MongoDB connection strings

### App-Specific Databases (one per app)

Each app has its own database with collections:

- `app_content`: Documents, notes, Q&As, URLs
- `app_guardrails`: Guardrail rules
- `chat_sessions`: Chat sessions
- `chat_messages`: Chat messages

## Benefits

1. **Complete Data Isolation**: Each client's data is completely isolated in separate databases
2. **Scalability**: Each app can scale independently
3. **Security**: No risk of data leakage between clients
4. **Flexibility**: Each app can have different database configurations
5. **Performance**: Reduced cross-tenant query interference
6. **Compliance**: Easier to meet data residency and compliance requirements

## Usage

### Creating a New App

Apps now require a MongoDB connection string:

```python
app_data = {
    "name": "My Chat Bot",
    "description": "A chatbot for my business",
    "defaultLanguage": "en",
    "availableLanguages": ["en", "es"],
    "welcomeMessage": {"en": "Welcome!"},
    "acknowledgmentMessage": {"en": "You're welcome!"},
    "googleApiKey": "your-api-key",
    "mongodbConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017/my_app_db"  # NEW REQUIRED FIELD
}
```

### API Usage

All existing API endpoints work the same way, but now automatically use the app's specific database based on the `x-app-id` header or app ID in the URL path.

## Testing

Run the comprehensive tests:

```bash
cd tests/
python run_tests.py
```

Or run individual tests:

```bash
python test_multi_tenant.py
python create_valid_app.py
```

## Migration Notes

- Existing apps in the database will need to be updated with `mongodbConnectionString` field
- Existing data will need to be migrated from the main database to app-specific databases
- All app creation processes must now include the MongoDB connection string

## Future Enhancements

1. **Database Migration Tool**: Create utility to migrate existing single-tenant data to multi-tenant structure
2. **Connection Pool Management**: Optimize connection pooling for multiple databases
3. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring for app-specific database health and performance
4. **Backup Strategy**: Implement backup strategies for multiple databases
5. **Auto-scaling**: Consider auto-scaling databases based on app usage
